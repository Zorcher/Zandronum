# Zandronum
Game and master server support for the Zandronum source port.

This project demonstrates using an object-oriented approach to easily add game and server support to any client that uses the terms defined in the Interface DLL.  By overriding the method calls when those events are triggered, the developer doesn't have to worry about the technical details like writing socket code or creating forms to edit and modify settings.  All they have to do is tell the client how to parse and interpret the data coming in so it can be displayed to the user in a friendly way or get them into the game.

Look for our client supporting these methods coming out soon!
